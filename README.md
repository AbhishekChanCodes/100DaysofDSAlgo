# 100DaysofDSAlgo

Challenging myself to solve at least 3 problems involving Data Structures and Algorithms every day for 100 days.

The goal is to get better at problem-solving, practicing regularly and becoming a better programmer.

Most of my problems will be from LeetCode.com. The individual problem file has the problem statement, the approach and the solution function.
